A place to track my progress learning html, css and javascript!

I have been learning html, css, and javascript recently. This is just a place to upload some of very basic projects that I have used to get to grips with some of the concepts that I have been learning. Most will not be too polished - if it a project to practice javascript, it may not have any css for example. Some of the websites might look very weird. This is often because I have used that file as notes to remember the concepts later.
